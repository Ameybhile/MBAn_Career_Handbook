## Recruitment process in Consulting {-}
>Starting with the 2023 fall recruiting, Consulting Giants, such as MBB, have moved up their fall recruiting round 1 deadline from September in previous years to July. So we, as candidates, must start preparing in advance.\
Usually, when you submit an online application for a position in the consulting, you will receive an online assessment if your resume passes the initial screening, but some companies issue OTs to all candidates. After that, there will be one round of HR Pre-Talk and two or three rounds of case interview. If you pass all of them, you will receive an offer!

## Components of a Consultant interview porcess {-}
>Case interviews take very similar formats across the various consultancies where they are used. Before landing an offer at McKinsey, Bain, BCG or any similar firm, you will have to complete between four and six case interviews, divided into two rounds, with each interview lasting approximately 50-60 minutes. Here is the typical case interview timeline:\

### Interview timeline
* First 15-30 minutes: Fit Interview, assessing your motivation to be a consultant in that specific firm and your leadership and teamwork traits. Learn more about the fit interview in our article here.
* Next 30-40 minutes: Case Interview
* Last 5 minutes: Fit Interview, again. This time it’s about your questions for the interviewer.

### What skills Interviewers want to see from your interviews?
* PROBING MIND: Showing intellectual curiosity by asking relevant and insightful questions that show show critical thinking and proactive nature
* STRUCTURE: Structuring means creating a framework, i.e. a series of clear consecutive steps in order to get to a solution to the problem. The focus of case interview frameworks (and of the whole case in general) is not on reaching solution themselves, but rather on how to get there.
* PROBLEM SOLVING: You’ll be tested on your ability in identifying problems and drivers, isolating causes and effects, demonstrating creativity, and prioritizing issues.
* NUMERICAL AGILITY: In case interviews, you are expected to be quick and confident with (precise and approximated) numbers.
* COMMUNICATION: As in real consulting work, coming up with the best ideas in a consulting case interview is necessary, but not enough: you must be able to turn your answer into a compelling recommendation. Otherwise, your days and nights of hard work spent on case interview prep have been totally wasted.
