This is Eunguy. I was born in 1996 and grew up in South Korea. I went to Michigan State University and studied Supply Chain Management. After my junior year in college, I went back to South Korea to serve military as an operations sergeant for about two years. After the military experience, I finished my bechelor degree with online courses from MSU because of the pandemic. Meanwhile, I felt the need of capability handling data so I applied for graduate school with Business Analytics major.
