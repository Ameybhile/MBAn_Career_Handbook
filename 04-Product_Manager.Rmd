## What Do They Do? {-}

* Identify a problem - Product managers assess the market and suggest ways to leverage their company’s resources to create a product that will solve a problem for customers.

* Interview prospective customers - This enables product managers to get a feel for how the potential software or hardware product could be used and how much of a market exists for the product.

* Develop a proposal for the product - Product managers work closely with technologists to scope the technical parameters and determine what products and features will best align with the company’s business strategy. A great product that customers will love (and buy!) is said to have great product-market fit.

* Let the technical people build the tech - Product managers at this stage help things move along smoothly and check in to ensure the process stays on track.

* Ask thoughtful questions throughout. Keep the business strategy top of mind for the company. 

* Make sure the product works. Product managers constantly measure, test, and validate their product with their customers—to make sure that what the team has built meets customer needs as well as they had hoped. 

* Launch the product. Product managers work closely with the company’s marketing team to reach the right customers.

## Components of the Product Management Interview Process {-}

### Product Questions {-}

Questions about product are possibly the most common in PM interviews, which shouldn’t come as a surprise! Even if you’re not overly technical, the best way to prepare is to thoroughly read through the description of the role you’re applying for, and try to find some resources (dev blogs, press releases etc) on the products you’ll be working with. Being able to demonstrate your previous experience or Product Management education will be invaluable here.

* How would you prioritize resources when you have two important things to do but can’t do them both?
* Describe a scenario which required you to say no to an idea or project.
* How do you decide what and what not to build?
* What is a product you currently use every day, why and how would you improve it?
* There is a data point that indicates that there are more Uber drop-offs at the airport than pick-ups from the airport. Why is this the case and what would you do   within the product to change that?
* How would you improve the functionality 10x of what it is now?
 

### Technical Questions {-}

Very, rarely will you be asked any overly technical questions in a Product Manager interview. Unless you’re applying to be a Technical Product Manager, or you’re a few rounds in for a specific PM role which requires a higher tech skill set. In general, technical questions in PM interviews are designed to see how well you’d work with engineers, and to test your familiarity with the tech the company is working with.

* Our engineering teams are pretty used to employing x methodologies. What is your opinion of them? Have you used them in the past?
* What is the importance of engineers and technical teams as stakeholders? How do you integrate them into the overall product vision?
* Can you provide an example where a technical solution you or your team designed became a commercial product?
* How do you ensure that market-oriented teams fully understand technical challenges?
* When are Bayesian methods more appropriate than “Artificial Intelligence” techniques for predictive analytics?

 
### Analytical Questions {-}

A Product Manager has to come ready with an analytical mind in order to succeed. Some companies may ask you questions designed to reveal how you think, and how you’d approach a problem. The key when being asked these questions is not to rush yourself.

*  many people are currently online in Europe?
* How many windows are in New York City?
* How many iPads are sold in the USA every year?
* How much money is spent in the USA per year on GAS?
* How would you go about finding out the number of red cars in China?

###  Product Management Questions {-}
Product Management is different at every company, and every person approaches their craft differently. Gauging your understanding of the role helps the company to determine your culture fit for the PM team. If you walk in with a ‘CEO of the Product‘ mentality, and they’re looking for someone more humble and collaborative, you run the risk of being turned away. So just be yourself and be honest. If you’re the right PM for the team, they’ll see that straight away!

* What aspects of Product Management do you find the most exciting?
* Tell me about a time when you had to build or motivate a team.
* What do you think a day to day would be like for a Product Manager?
* How do you think Product Managers interact with engineers?
* How would you explain Product Management to a 5-year-old?


### Behavioral Questions {-} 

Seeing a list of skills is all well and good, but an interview gives a company a chance to gauge how you behave day to day. They want to know that you work well in high-pressure environments, that you’re able to influence without authority, and manage stakeholder expectations. If you’re asked about a situation you haven’t yet faced, instead of saying “I haven’t done that yet,” talk about how you would face it in future.

* Tell me about a challenging issue or challenge you took on
* Tell me about how you interact with customers/users?
* Talk about how you overcame product failures/challenges or poor feedback.
* Tell me about a time you had to influence someone.
* Tell me about a mistake you made and how you handled it.
