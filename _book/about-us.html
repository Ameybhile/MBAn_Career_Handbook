<p>Hey There, MBAn folk !! I’m Amey<br>
I was born and brought up in India, where I also completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science, after which I worked as a technology consultant for three years. During my time at Deloitte, I realized my interests lie at the interface of technology and business; And I needed to expand my skills and knowledge in these domains, which is when I decided to join Ross Business School.  
I wish to leverage data and apply ML/analytical frameworks to derive actionable insights and create value. I enjoy operating far outside my comfort zone and believe in the power of incremental improvements.<br>
Feel free to reach out; I am always happy to help :)</p>

<p>Hello everyone! This is Eunguy.<br>
I was born in 1996 and grew up in South Korea. I went to Michigan State University and studied Supply Chain Management. After my junior year in college, I went back to South Korea to serve military as an operations sergeant for about two years. After the military experience, I finished my bechelor degree with online courses from MSU because of the pandemic. Meanwhile, I felt the need of capability handling data so I applied for graduate school with Business Analytics major.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At this point at Ross, I am so exciting to build my network and equip myself with useful tools, such as Python, R, and SQL. As a business person, I am not used to these computer skills. However, someone said “the pain that doesn’t kill you will make you stronger.” I believe putting my time and effort for the next 10 months will develop my ability as a business analyst. I hope this career handbook brings some insights for you.</p>

<p>Hi, I’m Snow! I come from a southern city in China called Hangzhou. It’s warm there and seldomly snows. Every winter, I waited for snow and hoped the world can be covered in white when I wake up. That’s why my parents gave me the English name Snow. I went to US in 2019 for my undergrad study. Boston was my destination due to the attractiveness of snow. I spent three years at Boston and then moved to Ann Arbor for graduate study. People hate the long winter here, but I am looking forward to it!</p>

<p>I am a self-proclaimed true Midwestern girl that grew up in Livonia, Michigan (perfectly halfway between Ann Arbor and Detroit). I graduated from the University of Michigan College of Engineering in Spring 2022 with a B.S.E. in Chemical Engineering and am a current Master’s of Business Analytics student at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business. If there is one thing I took away from my undergraduate years, it is that the world will never run out of ways to improve, and thus never run out of problems to solve. Pushing the bounds of knowledge is what allows us to improve the systems around us, and that is why I value the potential of harnessing data - bringing me to the MBAn program to build my analytic skills to give data power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have experience working in Chemical Manufacturing, Engineering Research, and Higher Education. Outside of school, I love going to SoulCycle, going on walks with friends, watching Detroit sports, trying new coffee shops, and cooking! It is my dream to be an analyst by day, and cycling instructor by night.</p>
