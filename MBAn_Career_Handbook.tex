\begin{quote}
This handbook is for current and future MBAn students to understand how the program works, what the targeted jobs are, and how to prepare for recruiting processes. The handbook will first begin with an overview of the MBAn program, describing different resources available from the Ross experience, classes you may take, and the skills gained from it. Following this introduction, we will transition into the main section of the book, detailing career outcomes available to MBAn students, driven by research from other school's Business Analytics program, the CDO resources, and experiences from former Master of Management students that have moved onto careers. We will introduce techniques for going through career exploration independently while utilizing the guide. Next will be a chapter focusing on the overall recruiting process for the discussed careers and how MBAn students can prepare and plan for networking, applications, and interviews. We will accumulate best practices for resumes, cover letters, and interviews. A final section will be included detailing supportive resources for the challenges international students face when searching for careers in the U.S. and globally, including a dynamic list of companies that offer sponsorship. We recognize research and resources our team is able to provide over the next few weeks is non-exhaustive, but we hope for this handbook to be a baseline for future students of this program and can live on and be updated in the future as the Master of Business Analytics Graduates enter the workforce and find success in their careers.

Hey There, MBAn folk !! I'm Amey\\
I was born and brought up in India, where I also completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science, after which I worked as a technology consultant for three years. During my time at Deloitte, I realized my interests lie at the interface of technology and business; And I needed to expand my skills and knowledge in these domains, which is when I decided to join Ross Business School. ~
I wish to leverage data and apply ML/analytical frameworks to derive actionable insights and create value. I enjoy operating far outside my comfort zone and believe in the power of incremental improvements.\\
Feel free to reach out; I am always happy to help :)

Hello everyone! This is Eunguy.\\
I was born in 1996 and grew up in South Korea. I went to Michigan State University and studied Supply Chain Management. After my junior year in college, I went back to South Korea to serve military as an operations sergeant for about two years. After the military experience, I finished my bechelor degree with online courses from MSU because of the pandemic. Meanwhile, I felt the need of capability handling data so I applied for graduate school with Business Analytics major.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
At this point at Ross, I am so exciting to build my network and equip myself with useful tools, such as Python, R, and SQL. As a business person, I am not used to these computer skills. However, someone said ``the pain that doesn't kill you will make you stronger.'' I believe putting my time and effort for the next 10 months will develop my ability as a business analyst. I hope this career handbook brings some insights for you.

Hi, I'm Snow! I come from a southern city in China called Hangzhou. It's warm there and seldomly snows. Every winter, I waited for snow and hoped the world can be covered in white when I wake up. That's why my parents gave me the English name Snow. I went to US in 2019 for my undergrad study. Boston was my destination due to the attractiveness of snow. I spent three years at Boston and then moved to Ann Arbor for graduate study. People hate the long winter here, but I am looking forward to it!

\begin{quote}
I am a self-proclaimed true Midwestern girl that grew up in Livonia, Michigan (perfectly halfway between Ann Arbor and Detroit). I graduated from the University of Michigan College of Engineering in Spring 2022 with a B.S.E. in Chemical Engineering and am a current Master's of Business Analytics student at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business. If there is one thing I took away from my undergraduate years, it is that the world will never run out of ways to improve, and thus never run out of problems to solve. Pushing the bounds of knowledge is what allows us to improve the systems around us, and that is why I value the potential of harnessing data - bringing me to the MBAn program to build my analytic skills to give data power.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
I have experience working in Chemical Manufacturing, Engineering Research, and Higher Education. Outside of school, I love going to SoulCycle, going on walks with friends, watching Detroit sports, trying new coffee shops, and cooking! It is my dream to be an analyst by day, and cycling instructor by night.

\begin{quote}
You have data. To use this data to inform your decision-making, it needs to be relevant, well-organized, and preferably digital. Once your data is coherent, you proceed with analyzing it and creating dashboards and reports to understand your business's performance better. Then you set your sights on the future and start generating predictive analytics. With predictive analytics, you assess potential future scenarios and predict consumer behavior in creative ways.

\begin{quote}
The work of Business analysts and data scientists can seem similar---both find trends or patterns in data to reveal new ways for organizations to make better decisions about operations. But data scientists tend to have more responsibility and are generally considered more senior than data analysts.\\
Data scientists are often expected to form their own questions about the data, while data analysts might support teams that already have set goals in mind. A data scientist might also spend more time developing models, using machine learning, or incorporating advanced programming to find and analyze data.\\
Many data scientists can begin their careers as analysts or statisticians

This will test your problem-solving skills and how you manipulate data using algorithms, SQL, etc.

The coding aspect of a Data Science Interview takes the highest percentage, at 38\%. More than a third of your interview will be based on coding, which is normal as you're interviewing for a Data Science position.

Coding questions aim to analyse and evaluate a candidate's proficiency with computer science and its fundamentals. It can cover the following topics:

Data Structures: Arrays, Dictionary, Stack/Queues, Strings, Tree/Binary Tree, and more.
Algorithms: Binary Search, Recursion, Sorting, and more.
SQL: Constraints, Primary/Foreign Key, Join, and more

\hypertarget{statistics-21}{%
\subsection{Statistics (21\%)}\label{statistics-21}}

This will test your understanding of statistics as a whole and how you have and can apply them within problem-solving tasks.

Statistics is an important element of Data Science. Statistics help Data Scientists analyse large and complex datasets. It is heavily used for Machine Learning in improving models.

Understanding popular statistical terminology and how it can be implemented within Data Science tasks will help you thrive as a Data Scientist. It can cover the following topics:

Probability Distributions
Hypothesis Testing
Modeling

\hypertarget{machine-learning-17}{%
\subsection{Machine learning (17\%)}\label{machine-learning-17}}

This will test your ability to understand the theory behind Machine Learning, how to build models, how it applies to a specific problem/task at hand, and how you can improve it.

With the use of Machine Learning models in our day-to-day lives, it becomes an important aspect of Data Science and how we can continuously improve it to be implemented into businesses and more.

Data Scientists are known for solving problems and creating models, therefore during a Data Science interview, the interviewer will test your ability to build models, the overall workflow, and how to improve it.

It can cover the following topics:

Artificial Intelligence
Model building, validations, and interpretations
Types of Algorithms
Use cases of Machine Learning
Example questions would be:

\hypertarget{business-case-problems-12}{%
\subsection{Business Case problems (12\%)}\label{business-case-problems-12}}

This will test your understanding of technical knowledge and how it can be used to drive business and determine the right decision to make.

The reason that data is so valuable is that it can give people a greater understanding of the data and it can help make important decisions.

Applying technical knowledge to business case scenarios will help the interviewer understand how you can improve and help grow the company using your skills.

It can cover the following topics:

Performance and limitations of a product
Business short-term and long-term goals
Example questions would be:

\hypertarget{behavioral-questions-13}{%
\subsection{Behavioral questions (13\%)}\label{behavioral-questions-13}}

This will test your characteristics and determine if you are a good fit for the company.

Although the majority of technical jobs require heavy hard skills, soft skills are just as important. Your soft skills will determine if you are the right fit for the role.

During the behavioral stage, articulating yourself using elements of your resume to back your point will make you successful.

For example, some companies may prefer a candidate who is highly independent and requires little to no interaction. The interviewer will scan through your resume and ask how you had worked in your previous companies and your preferred working method. You will have an understanding that they require an independent employee and can draw out past experiences where you were independent.

  Identify a problem - Product managers assess the market and suggest ways to leverage their company's resources to create a product that will solve a problem for customers.
\item
  Interview prospective customers - This enables product managers to get a feel for how the potential software or hardware product could be used and how much of a market exists for the product.
\item
  Develop a proposal for the product - Product managers work closely with technologists to scope the technical parameters and determine what products and features will best align with the company's business strategy. A great product that customers will love (and buy!) is said to have great product-market fit.
\item
  Let the technical people build the tech - Product managers at this stage help things move along smoothly and check in to ensure the process stays on track.
\item
  Ask thoughtful questions throughout. Keep the business strategy top of mind for the company.
\item
  Make sure the product works. Product managers constantly measure, test, and validate their product with their customers---to make sure that what the team has built meets customer needs as well as they had hoped.
\item
  Launch the product. Product managers work closely with the company's marketing team to reach the right customers.

Data Scientists are known for solving problems and creating models, therefore during a Data Science interview, the interviewer will test your ability to build models, the overall workflow, and how to improve it.

It can cover the following topics:

Artificial Intelligence
Model building, validations, and interpretations
Types of Algorithms
Use cases of Machine Learning
Example questions would be:

\hypertarget{business-case-problems-12-1}{%
\subsection{Business Case problems (12\%)}\label{business-case-problems-12-1}}

This will test your understanding of technical knowledge and how it can be used to drive business and determine the right decision to make.

The reason that data is so valuable is that it can give people a greater understanding of the data and it can help make important decisions.

Applying technical knowledge to business case scenarios will help the interviewer understand how you can improve and help grow the company using your skills.

It can cover the following topics:

Performance and limitations of a product
Business short-term and long-term goals
Example questions would be:

\hypertarget{behavioral-questions-13-1}{%
\subsection{Behavioral questions (13\%)}\label{behavioral-questions-13-1}}

This will test your characteristics and determine if you are a good fit for the company.

Although the majority of technical jobs require heavy hard skills, soft skills are just as important. Your soft skills will determine if you are the right fit for the role.

During the behavioral stage, articulating yourself using elements of your resume to back your point will make you successful.

For example, some companies may prefer a candidate who is highly independent and requires little to no interaction. The interviewer will scan through your resume and ask how you had worked in your previous companies and your preferred working method. You will have an understanding that they require an independent employee and can draw out past experiences where you were independent.

Hey There, MBAn folk !! I'm Amey\\
I was born and brought up in India, where I also completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science, after which I worked as a technology consultant for three years. During my time at Deloitte, I realized my interests lie at the interface of technology and business; And I needed to expand my skills and knowledge in these domains, which is when I decided to join Ross Business School. ~
I wish to leverage data and apply ML/analytical frameworks to derive actionable insights and create value. I enjoy operating far outside my comfort zone and believe in the power of incremental improvements.\\
Feel free to reach out; I am always happy to help :)

Hello everyone! This is Eunguy.\\
I was born in 1996 and grew up in South Korea. I went to Michigan State University and studied Supply Chain Management. After my junior year in college, I went back to South Korea to serve military as an operations sergeant for about two years. After the military experience, I finished my bechelor degree with online courses from MSU because of the pandemic. Meanwhile, I felt the need of capability handling data so I applied for graduate school with Business Analytics major.

At this point at Ross, I am so exciting to build my network and equip myself with useful tools, such as Python, R, and SQL. As a business person, I am not used to these computer skills. However, someone said ``the pain that doesn't kill you will make you stronger.'' I believe putting my time and effort for the next 10 months will develop my ability as a business analyst. I hope this career handbook brings some insights for you.

Hi, I'm Snow! I come from a southern city in China called Hangzhou. It's warm there and seldomly snows. Every winter, I waited for snow and hoped the world can be covered in white when I wake up. That's why my parents gave me the English name Snow. I went to US in 2019 for my undergrad study. Boston was my destination due to the attractiveness of snow. I spent three years at Boston and then moved to Ann Arbor for graduate study. People hate the long winter here, but I am looking forward to it!

\begin{quote}
I am a self-proclaimed true Midwestern girl that grew up in Livonia, Michigan (perfectly halfway between Ann Arbor and Detroit). I graduated from the University of Michigan College of Engineering in Spring 2022 with a B.S.E. in Chemical Engineering and am a current Master's of Business Analytics student at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business. If there is one thing I took away from my undergraduate years, it is that the world will never run out of ways to improve, and thus never run out of problems to solve. Pushing the bounds of knowledge is what allows us to improve the systems around us, and that is why I value the potential of harnessing data - bringing me to the MBAn program to build my analytic skills to give data power.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
I have experience working in Chemical Manufacturing, Engineering Research, and Higher Education. Outside of school, I love going to SoulCycle, going on walks with friends, watching Detroit sports, trying new coffee shops, and cooking! It is my dream to be an analyst by day, and cycling instructor by night.
