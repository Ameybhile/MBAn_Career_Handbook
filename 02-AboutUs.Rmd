I am a self-proclaimed true Midwestern girl that grew up in Livonia, Michigan (perfectly halfway between Ann Arbor and Detroit). I graduated from the University of Michigan College of Engineering in Spring 2022 with a B.S.E. in Chemical Engineering and am a current Master's of Business Analytics student at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business. If there is one thing I took away from my undergraduate years, it is that the world will never run out of ways to improve, and thus never run out of problems to solve. Pushing the bounds of knowledge is what allows us to improve the systems around us, and that is why I value the potential of harnessing data - bringing me to the MBAn program to build my analytic skills to give data power. 

I have experience working in Chemical Manufacturing, Engineering Research, and Higher Education. Outside of school, I love going to SoulCycle, going on walks with friends, watching Detroit sports, trying new coffee shops, and cooking! It is my dream to be an analyst by day, and cycling instructor by night.
