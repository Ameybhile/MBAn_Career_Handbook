> For an international student, this document will guide you to maintain a legal residency in the US while working off campus after graduation or during your study. Off-campus employment without the appropriate work permit would be viewed as a breach of your visa requirements. As a penalty, you may lose one's legal immigration status in the United States, cause a potential deportation by the Department of Homeland Security, and put you on a situation in which extremely difficult future attempts to obtain a visa for entry into the United States.

## Types of student visa: F-1 vs J-1 {-}
Who is paying for the schooling is a key factor in evaluating eligibility for a J1 or F1 status. If a student receives funding from personnel sources, external sources, OR a mix of the two, they are qualified for an F1 status. A J1 visa requires a significant or "substantive" amount of the funding to come from an outside source, such as a university or the government, in contrast to an F1 visa, which does not have this requirement.

### F-1 Students {-}
Please keep in mind that any off-campus job for F-1 students must be allowed. To obtain a legal work permit, you must apply for CPT and OPT. There are other employment options, such as international organization employment, on-campus employment, and severe economic hardship employment. Nonetheless, only two options, CPT and OPT, will be discussed for F-1 status since our handbook mainly explored the most possible careers. If you want to see all options, [__click here__](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/students/f1-students/employment-options).

#### CPT {-}

Curricular practical training (CPT) is for a student who wants to work off campus during the program. This work authorization must be approved each semester. 

##### Part-time vs Full-time {-}
+ Part-time CPT: 
Work that is 20 hours a week or less is regarded as part-time. To preserve legal F-1 status for the fall and winter terms, you must be enrolled in classes full-time and physically present on campus at all times. 

+ Full-time CPT: 
A job is considered full-time if it requires more than 20 hours a week. Please be informed that after completing 12 consecutive months of full-time CPT, you will not be eligible for Optional Practical Training (OPT). You must enroll full-time or have a certified reduced course load for the fall and winter terms (RCL).

#### OPT {-}

OPT stands for optional practical training. The Federal Regulations describe OPT as temporary work that is closely related to a student's field of study. It allows you to maintain F-1 status after your graduation.

The typical OPT period has a 12-month maximum cumulative length. The 12-month cap is reduced by 50% for part-time OPT. Some F-1 students with degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) may request an extension of their optional practical training program by 24 months (letâ€™s go MBAn!). If an F-1 moves up to a higher educational level, they might qualify for another 12 months of OPT. 

##### For the student to be qualified for OPT, they must: {-}
+ Occupy a valid F-1 visa status. 
+ Have studied full-time for at least one academic year. 
+ Have U-M-approved health insurance

### J-1 Students {-}
Employment is any type of job done or service rendered in return for cash, tuition, fees, books, supplies, a place to stay, or any other advantage or payment. For all jobs, J-1 students must get permission to work from the institution that sponsors the program (the U-M International Center). The student may lose the benefits of the J-1 program and risk losing their ability to enter or remain in the United States if they breach their J-1 status by working without the required authorization.

#### Employment Authorization {-}
The U.S. Department of State has designated the U-M International Center as the University of Michigan's J-1 program sponsor. The U-M International Center is required to assess the proposed employment in light of your educational goals and personal situation. You can apply for job permission at the U-M International Center if your DS-2019 lists "University of Michigan" as the program sponsor and "student" as the exchange visitor category. You cannot start working until the begin date is effective and you have received employment authorization from the U-M International Center.
