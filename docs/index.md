This website is for current and future MBAn students to understand how the program works, what the targeted jobs are, and how to prepare for recruiting processes. The handbook will first begin with an overview of the MBAn program, describing different resources available from the Ross experience, classes you may take, and the skills gained from it. 

Following this introduction, we will transition into the main section of the book, detailing career outcomes available to MBAn students, driven by research from other schoolâ€™s Business Analytics program, and the CDO resources. We will introduce techniques for going through career exploration independently while utilizing the guide. This book will detail the career paths of Business Analysts & Data Scientists, Product Managers, and Consultants, to give users a deep understanding of the process of obtaining these jobs and what their roles' entail. These chapters will focus on overall recruiting process how MBAn students can prepare and plan for networking, applications, and interviews. 

A following chapter will be included detailing supportive resources for the challenges international students face when searching for careers in the U.S. and globally. Then, a final chapter is included discussing the process our team went through throughout this course to work together, form a team, and build this book.

We recognize research and resources our team is able to provide over the next few weeks is non-exhaustive, but we hope for this handbook to be a baseline for future students of this program and can live on and be updated in the future as the Master of Business Analytics Graduates enter the workforce and find success in their careers. 

Built by MBAn '23 students, we hope you learn as much from our page as we did building it.
