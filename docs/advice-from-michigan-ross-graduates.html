<h2>Jack Zimmerman<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#jack-zimmerman"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Jack is a Master’s of Management ’21 graduate now working as an analyst in strategy and analytics at Deloitte. His current role is focused on IT operating model designs and shifting away from prior methods of delivering tech solutions (waterfall/hybrid) towards more agile approaches. In this consulting-oriented role, he commonly uses Excel to develop financial and other models, and then utilizes PowerPoint to craft stories and develop content from the models. Outside of this work, he has responsibilities concerning project management such as status reports and updates.</p>
<div id="consulting-perspective" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Consulting Perspective<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#consulting-perspective"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Consulting can be a broad variety of roles, there are some people that do strategy work on one end, and others that are more technical on the opposite side of things. In the middle of this spectrum are more flexible roles that combine both aspects. I’m in the middle, leaning towards the more strategic side.<br>
Certain people specialize in analytics, while other colleagues use R and python to work with larger sets of data. Business tech solutions roles require some level of coding experience, but analytics is also used with smaller data sets using excel. Different problems require different skill sets, and MBAn grads could absolutely be successful in consulting.”</p>

<div id="recruiting-process" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Recruiting Process<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#recruiting-process"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Coming into his year in MM, Jack had a set plan on recruiting for consulting firms such as McKinsey, BGC, EY, Deloitte, and Kearney. For most of the companies he interviewed with, there was typically two rounds of interviews with a combination of behavioral questions and a case study. Jack pointed out an important distinction between different job interviews is the type of case you may encounter. For example, for strategy-profile consulting roles, applicants will have a traditional consulting case study, but for analytics focused careers such as tech solutions and software engineering roles there is an increasing amount of technology questions, and/or coding showcases involved with the case study aspect.</p>
<p>When it comes to behavioral interviews, Jack had a great strategy of developing the answers that best tell his story. He would prep by going on a website with sample behavioral questions and pull up a doc side by side and write 1-2 stories for each prompt and add a few bullet points that build context for each. Then, he would review everything he wrote, refine his answers, think of the themes and questions the stories apply to and organize the document. Then, he would quickly read over this document before interviews to have his best stories primed at the top of his mind so during the interviews he could quickly think of the best examples of himself for questions and focus on telling them clearly and concisely.</p>
<p>One thing he wished he would have done differently is take the time to explore other opportunities beyond consulting. Through electives he took he discovered his long term goals involved solving big problems using technology. He recommends taking electives that pique your interest over classes that may be easier to help develop your interests and skills for your future job search.</p>
<p>When it comes to balancing school and recruiting simultaneously, Jack viewed it as a full time job: he set up his 9-5 as his workday, consisting of his classes, networking, going on LinkedIn, and doing his homework. Then, he was able to balance this by having his evenings to himself to spend time with friends and relax. By viewing recruiting as part of his work and scheduling his time to manage that, it helped him be more proactive during the process.</p>

<h3>Jack’s Top Advice<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#jacks-top-advice"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start Early - beginning the process as soon as possible allows for more time to work through the process and obtain results.<br>
</li>
<li>Craft Your Narrative - Being in these lesser-known OYM programs can be leveraged as a huge advantage during the recruiting process. With no preconceptions about your graduate program, you are able to sell a story to recruiters about what makes your unique experience perfect for the job you are applying for.<br>
</li>
<li>Use the CDO Resources Extensively - Meeting with John, Josh, and peer coaches each week can help you hone your recruiting strategy, work on case studies, and polish your resume so you are prepared.<br>
</li>
<li>You Get Out What You Put In - Committing the time and effort to use the resources around you, network, and discover roles you are interested in lead you to get far more out of the process and closer to your goals.</li>
