</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A product manager connects business strategy, design knowledge, and customer needs in order to develop a product that is relevant, feasible, and valuable. PMs are focused on optimizing a product to achieve the business goals and user necessities while maximizing return on investment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They are the overseers of a company’s products and the technological innovation behind them, and the stewards of that innovation’s role in meeting the customers’ needs in the marketplace.</p>

</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Identify a problem - Product managers assess the market and suggest ways to leverage their company’s resources to create a product that will solve a problem for customers.</p></li>
<li><p>Interview prospective customers - This enables product managers to get a feel for how the potential software or hardware product could be used and how much of a market exists for the product.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a proposal for the product - Product managers work closely with technologists to scope the technical parameters and determine what products and features will best align with the company’s business strategy. A great product that customers will love (and buy!) is said to have great product-market fit.</p></li>
<li><p>Let the technical people build the tech - Product managers at this stage help things move along smoothly and check in to ensure the process stays on track.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask thoughtful questions throughout. Keep the business strategy top of mind for the company.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the product works. Product managers constantly measure, test, and validate their product with their customers—to make sure that what the team has built meets customer needs as well as they had hoped.</p></li>
<li><p>Launch the product. Product managers work closely with the company’s marketing team to reach the right customers.</p></li>
