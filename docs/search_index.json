I’m Amey &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 9fe5d534ace9b037c9fcb218b8a1ef0aa7bbefb7 I was born and brought up in India, where I also completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science, after which I worked as a technology consultant for three years. During my time at Deloitte, I realized my interests lie at the interface of technology and business; And I needed to expand my skills and knowledge in these domains, which is when I decided to join Ross Business School.   I wish to leverage data and apply ML/analytical frameworks to derive actionable insights and create value. I enjoy operating far outside my comfort zone and believe in the power of incremental improvements. Feel free to reach out; I am always happy to help :) “Data is just summaries of thousands of stories - tell a few of them to the world, and you are a data analyst.” 2.2 Eunguy Lee &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD "],["hello-everyone-this-is-eunguy.-i-was-born-in-1996-and-grew-up-in-south-korea.-i-went-to-michigan-state-university-and-studied-supply-chain-management.-after-my-junior-year-in-college-i-went-back-to-south-korea-to-serve-military-as-an-operations-sergeant-for-about-two-years.-after-the-military-experience-i-finished-my-bechelor-degree-with-online-courses-from-msu-because-of-the-pandemic.-meanwhile-i-felt-the-need-of-capability-handling-data-so-i-applied-for-graduate-school-with-business-analytics-major..html", "Chapter 3 &gt;Hello everyone!

As a business person, I am not used to these computer skills. However, someone said “the pain that doesn’t kill you will make you stronger.” I believe putting my time and effort for the next 10 months will develop my ability as a business analyst. I hope this career handbook brings some insights for you. 3.1 Snow Shen &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD "]]
