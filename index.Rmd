This website is for current and future MBAn students to understand how the program works, what the targeted jobs are, and how to prepare for recruiting processes. The handbook will first begin with an overview of the MBAn program, describing different resources available from the Ross experience, classes you may take, and the skills gained from it. Following this introduction, we will transition into the main section of the book, detailing career outcomes available to MBAn students, driven by research from other schoolâ€™s Business Analytics program, the CDO resources, and experiences from former Master of Management students that have moved onto careers. We will introduce techniques for going through career exploration independently while utilizing the guide. Next will be a chapter focusing on the overall recruiting process for the discussed careers and how MBAn students can prepare and plan for networking, applications, and interviews. We will accumulate best practices for resumes, cover letters, and interviews. A final section will be included detailing supportive resources for the challenges international students face when searching for careers in the U.S. and globally, including a dynamic list of companies that offer sponsorship. We recognize research and resources our team is able to provide over the next few weeks is non-exhaustive, but we hope for this handbook to be a baseline for future students of this program and can live on and be updated in the future as the Master of Business Analytics Graduates enter the workforce and find success in their careers.

This book is certainly non-exhaustive, and should serve as a starting point for exploring career possibilities! Built by MBAn '23 students, we hope you learn as much from our page as we did building it.
